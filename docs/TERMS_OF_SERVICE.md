# TERMS OF SERVICE

> Effective as of: **December 7, 2024**. 
> Last updated: **December 17, 2024**.

Welcome to **QueerBot**!

This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Terms") governs your access and use of **QueerBot** and its related services (collectively referred to as the "Bot", "QueerBot"), a Discord bot developed by **Renee Steinberg** ("We"). 

By using the Bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Bot.

To use the Bot, you must also agree to and abide by Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

## 1. About the Bot
QueerBot is a bot for the chat and social platform [Discord](https://discord.com/) provided by Discord Inc., using Discord’s public [API](https://discord.dev/). QueerBot does not abuse Discord's services, knowingly or otherwise.

You may **not** use QueerBot to:

- Send unsolicited advertisements (spam) via direct messages or public channels. 
- Flood servers or users with excessive messages.
- Violate Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

If you discover misuse of the Bot, please report it immediately or via the [support server](https://discord.gg/MBSZcwmvVk) or at renee.t.steinberg@gmail.com.

## 2. License

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, and revocable license to use the Bot and its services:

- **Permitted Use:** You may use the Bot for personal or server-based activities, unless stated otherwise.
- **Restrictions:** You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of the Bot or its backend services.

## 3. Restrictions on Use

The Bot enables server administrators and moderators to send messages or perform moderation actions. Because the Bot's messages can sometimes make the *responsible party* unclear, we are liable for any messages or actions the Bot performs within their server. 

You may **not**: 
- **Send Spam or Advertisements:** Use the Bot to send unsolicited advertisements via direct messages or channels. 
- **Hide Message Origins:** Modify the Bot's messages to hide which server or user initiated them. All messages must remain clearly identifiable as coming from your server. 
- **Spam Messages:** Send repeated messages in a short time span, especially via direct messages. 
- **Violate Discord Policies:** Use the Bot on servers or in ways that violate Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. 
- **Access the Backend:** Direct access to the Bot's backend (e.g., unauthorized API calls) is strictly prohibited. 
- **Automated Scraping:** Use automated tools, bots, or software to interact with the Bot's services outside their intended use.

## 4. Compliance with Discord Policies

The Bot complies with Discord's Developer Terms and Community Guidelines. Misuse of the Bot that causes Discord policy violations may lead to termination of its use in your server.

## 5. Changes to the Service

We may update the Bot's functionality or these Terms periodically. If changes impact your use of the Bot, you will be notified in the _#updates_ channel of the [support server](https://discord.gg/MBSZcwmvVk) at least 14 days prior to the changes taking effect.

 - **Notifications:** You acknowledge that you will not receive notifications about changes to the Terms if you are not in the support server or if notifications are disabled.
 - **Support Server Rules:** Failure to adhere to the rules in the #rules channel may result in removal from the support server, after which you will no longer receive updates.

Your continued use of the Bot after we make changes to these Terms indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.

It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to ensure you remain in agreement.

## 6. Liability

As the server owner or administrator:
-  You are responsible for ensuring that the use of the Bot within your server complies with these Terms and Discord’s policies.
- You are responsible for all actions or messages generated by the Bot within your server.

We are not liable for:
- Misuse of the Bot by you or your server members.
- Damages resulting from the Bot’s services, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, or other intangible losses.

## 7. Termination

The Bot may terminate or suspend access to its services at any time, without notice, for violation of these Terms or other necessary reasons. You may also remove the Bot from your server to discontinue its use.

## 8. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Latvia and applicable European Union regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Any disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these laws and regulations.

## 9. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us via the [support server](https://discord.gg/MBSZcwmvVk) or at renee.t.steinberg@gmail.com.
